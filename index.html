                                We all want change, but we constantly tend to fall into our old habits. Are you looking for someone who can give that little push so that you and your co-workers will effectively support change? Then you’ve come to the right place. I am ready to guide you, with humour, creativity and lots of passion for cultural change.

I recently decided to go one step further and explore new horizons, where I can bring some help and support to make the change happen …

                    B2B (better2best) provides trainings, workshops and lectures inspiring your team, your company or your audience to do better every day so that they can become the best in the long run.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    We combine different modules (see “modules”) to an interesting story. This story is brought to you either as a training or as a lecture/keynote.
                    The concepts that are covered in each of the modules are easy to understand, practical and ready to use, whatever you position, whatever your sector. Moreover, the new insights are not only applicable at work but are also of use in your private life.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    If you opt for a training, together we select the modules and their related concepts. You should plan 30’ min. to 90’ max. per module. Each of the modules can be extended with a workshop on “how to deal with the learnings in practice”. Add min. 15’ to max. 30’ per workshop. Comparing it to a journey we will undertake, this arrangement can be booked from upwards of 10 participants and can last as long as you want.

                    Before we take off on our journey, we first look into the mirror and discover the modules that are directly linked with the individual. We ask ourselves the following questions: What makes me tick? Why am I who I am? Why do I behave in a certain way? Why do I have my own outlook on things? What are my habits? How do I discover new insights?

                    B2B (better2best) provides trainings, workshops and lectures inspiring your team, your company or your audience to do better every day so that they can become the best in the long run.

                    We combine different modules (see “modules”) to an interesting story. This story is brought to you either as a training or as a lecture/keynote.
                    The concepts that are covered in each of the modules are easy to understand, practical and ready to use, whatever you position, whatever your sector. Moreover, the new insights are not only applicable at work but are also of use in your private life.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    If you opt for a training, together we select the modules and their related concepts. You should plan 30’ min. to 90’ max. per module. Each of the modules can be extended with a workshop on “how to deal with the learnings in practice”. Add min. 15’ to max. 30’ per workshop. Comparing it to a journey we will undertake, this arrangement can be booked from upwards of 10 participants and can last as long as you want.

                        Since 2017 new employees encounter <b>leading@bpost</b> for the first time a couple of months after their recruiment. The experience is always somewhat comparable: they all participate with enthousiasm, leave the session with new insights and happily express their positive impression. Regularly we receive the feedback “one of the best trainings ever!”. The experience that b2b offers is quite comparable…
